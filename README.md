# Contact-Management-System
This application is a digital contact management system that replicates something you might find on your cell phone. It goes through a broad range of options such as displaying contacts, adding a contact, updating a contact, deleting a contact, searching for contacts, and sorting through contacts. It's more or less a culmination of knowledge, iteration, validation, and modulatory.
